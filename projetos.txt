                        <strong>Building a Datawarehouse to fix our HR Data Quality</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>As is most likely the case with most Governments, at the State of Rondônia we have
                        multiple pieces of software that have something to do with HR. Unfortunately —and predictably— 
                        those softwares have become data silos, each with their own ways of storing data,
                        resulting in a veeeery fun time for those of us in the Data Engineering Team. 
                        This means that we can't answer some very basic questions, such as: 
                        how many people work as civil servants in our state? I've been eyeing this project ever since
                        I was just a team member, but it's only recently that we've acquired the capabilites of 
                        handling this beast.

                        <strong>Developing a Flow-Based Chatbot Creation Platform</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>Every now and then, a task would come by that would leave me a bit confused.
                        Why did a Whatsapp-based chabot become something for the Data Engineering team to handle?
                        Regardless, this is the longest-running project I have ever been a part of, 
                        while also being the first Saas product I've developed. From humble
                         beginnings with a makeshift Node.js bot using Venom.js, we'd eventually end up with two micro-services and a highly 
                        configurable structure. I'm very proud of our team in this one.

                        <strong>Researching Data Lake Software and Methodologies</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>After a looong time, the team was finally ready to start working towards building a Data Lake,
                        however we had three major issues ahead of us: some nasty Infrastructure issues, the lack of a DevOps team,
                        and no clear methodology towards building a Data Lake. As of 2023, even though the concept of a Data Lake
                         is widespread around the world, there was almost no talk about the actual work that goes into building a Data Lake beyond pure tools, and 
                        also the concept of just placing all your data in a single place and then having to handle progressively
                        more complex extractions sounded simply not very smart. While looking for alternative structures to the 
                        traditional Data Lake, we'd eventually come across the Data Mesh and Data Lakehouse methodologies, of which
                        we decided to adopt some parts of, while adapting other parts to better fit our uncommon situation.

                        <strong>Building a Forest Fire Alert Software for the State's Firefighters</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>The state of Rondônia is situated in a corner of the Amazon Rainforest, and as inconceivable 
                        as it may sound, it faces a massive forest fire issue in the latter half of each year. Most of
                         it is not controllable, such as criminal fires, however a part of it was that we didn't 
                         have a proper alert system for our Firefighters. The main developer for this project wasn't me,
                         since my vacation was just around the corner, so I mostly did the requirements and 
                         early parts of development. The main developer for this one was my intern at the time, Oséias,
                         who soon after was not an intern anymore!

                        <strong>Trying to adopt Apache Superset, and Failing.</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>As the Data Engineering team evolved, I began looking at our BI team, where we were(and still are)
                        mostly using PowerBI ReportServer as our BI alternative. PowerBI is, for the most part, capable of 
                        handling the work we throw at it. However!! it suffers from a poor web integration, which limits
                        our outreach efforts and also the accessibility of the work done by our BI team.
                         While looking for something that would better integrate with web platforms, I ended up finding Apache Superset, which we then tried to 
                        adopt. As it turns out, other than the platform itself being very finicky, asking our BI 
                        team to use CSS was a bit much, especially when there was no developer on their team.

                    <p>As is often the case when starting with data engineering, 
                        we had some legacy (but absolutely critical) 
                        Pentaho jobs running on a misconfigured Windows VM. After 
                        implementing Apache Hop, we decided to eliminate Pentaho 
                        entirely and migrate all the jobs to Hop. Luckily, Hop 
                        has a built-in feature for that, which saved us many hours.

                    </h4>
                    <p>Even though I usually like writing documentation, this one was a LOT of work.
                        For starters - the data team is mostly composed of non-developer backgrounds, 
                        such as: two Mechatronic Engineers, a Statistician, and so on. Another issue is that we
                        work at a Government institution, and as such there is also the issue that everyone around
                        us writes in a way that is very inconvenient for writing about tech, and even more so when 
                        talking about complex projects. In a very interesting timing, our Infrastructure team had 
                        just deployed a Wiki.js for us to use as our main documentation plaform.

                        As I mentioned on a previous Data Engineering card, 
                        our team didn’t really have programmers—just me and Juan.
                         Then Juan left (for a cooler job). 
                         With no one else on the team having a strong programming background,
                          I had to find an alternative that required less coding. 
                          Enter Apache Hop, Pentaho’s cooler sibling, 
                          which I promptly integrated into our Airflow stack. 
                        Hop was a very welcome addition to our Stack, and I even got to host a tech talk about it
                         at our Government Tech Conference.

                         That’s when I noticed: our help-desk could really use some automation. This realization led
                          to my Capstone Project for my Software Engineering graduation, 
                        and it’s one of the projects I’m proudest of.</p>
